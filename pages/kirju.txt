====== Kirju ======
The Kirju are a sentient gaseous lifeform. They control dolls usually in the shape of humanoid creatures (usually humans) via telekinesis. A glass orb inside the head of the doll acts as a vessel to store their gaseous form.

In order to see, most dolls have holes for eyes (sometimes with lenses) that lead directly to the brain orb, leaving their gaseous form visible through them. It is said that their eyes are especially beautiful.

==== Offence Racial Traits ====
=== Telekinesis ===
Kirju can attune themselves to allow them to control a weapon or item via telekinesis. After 3d6 days of attuning, they can wield any weapon at 5ft reach at lvl1, 10ft reach at lvl 8 and 15ft reach at lvl 15. They use their Intelligence in place of strength when using a weapon in this way. 

If a Kirju brain orb is moved into another doll body, their dexterity is reduced to 0. They regain 1d3 dexterity every week of practice.

==== Defence Racial Traits ====
=== Healing ===
Given the right supplies, a Kirju can repair their doll by 1 point per day per level.

==== Weakness Racial Traits ====
=== Incapable of arcane magic ===
Kirju cannot hear [[Habica:The Song]] or [[Low Space:The Rhythm]] and as such find arcane spell casting difficult / impossible on their own. With the aid of a technological device that can relay the sound to them it is possible for them to cast arcane magic but it is highly unusual skill.
