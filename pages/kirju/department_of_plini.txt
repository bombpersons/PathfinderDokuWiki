====== Department of Plini ======
[[Plini]] is mostly ignored by the rest of [[:Kurji]] organization. Very few [[:Kurji]] and resources are sent there. They answer directly to [[The Council]], although [[The Council]] hasn't asked anything of them since their creation in 1121 AF.

===== Caretakers =====
The caretakers attend to repairs and general maintenance of the internal structure of [[Plini]]. They also ensure that the internals remain unknown to sentient life on [[Plini]].

==== Kardjan ====
Kardjan, born 1133 AF, became a [[reality scientist]] early on in its career at the age of 100. Kardjan became known for his experiments into large scale reality alteration, pushing the limits on what was thought possible at the time. Many of the current experimental mass teleportation techniques were developed by it and its team. 

Later on in Kardjans career during the 1300s, it wrote the paper [[The shape of the universe - Evidence for a lower space]]. Convincing a large portion of the scientific community, Kardjan received much support from [[The Council]] to prove its theory. Many Kirju worried that if [[Lower Space]] did exist, that a higher space might also exist, although Kardjans theory mostly dismissed the idea due to lack of evidence. 

Most of Kardjans experiments trying to find [[Lower Space]] involved creating massive energy output in [[Low Space]] in the hopes that micro tears in space might be found. Kardjan ramped up its experiments each time, pushing the limits to what [[The Council]] would approve. In its final experiment, Kardjan tricked [[The Council]] into approving an experiment that actually involved an energy output 100 times what they were told, obliterating an entire galaxy. Despite this, no micro tears in space were ever found. 

In 1622 AF, as a punishment for misleading [[The Council]], as well as the destruction of a galaxy and the potential life there, Kardjan was banned from [[High Space]], and re-assigned to be a caretaker on [[Plini]].
