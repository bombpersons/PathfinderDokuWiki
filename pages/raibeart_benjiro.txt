==== Raibeart Benjiro ====
A private collector. Collects specifically crowns from druidic ruins. Has a collection of non-crown items he's acquired that he's willing to trade.

PC's find a letter reading:

<code>
Dear Sir or Madam,
Rumour has it that you are in possession of a functional druidic crown. I, Raibeart Benjiro, am assembling a collection of druidic crowns from all over Nammach, and I would be delighted if yours could become part of it. 

Now I'm sure you have all sorts of different offers from various buyers, so I shall make a different offer for you. I keep a large collection of magical artefacts, and if we could meet, would be willing to offer some for a swap. What do you say?
Yours faithfully.
</code>

He is willing to swap up to 5 points of items. A DC 20 diplomacy check will persuade him to swap up to 7 points of items.
