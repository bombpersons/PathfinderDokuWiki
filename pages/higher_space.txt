===== History =====

==== Before the fall of the Great Benvaubo'u ====
After many thousands of years of observation in [[High space]] the [[Great Benvaubo'u]] located a crack leading to a higher [[plane]], immediately forcing the crack open and sending observational equipment through. In an effort to understand how to manipulate [[High space]] through [[Higher space]], the [[Plini Experiment]] was created.
