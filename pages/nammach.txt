**Nammach** is an island in the northern tropical region of the [[Darori Arc]]. It has a surface area of 233,000 km<sup>2</sup> and is 194 km wide and 120 km tall.

===== Geography =====
The centre of Nammach consists of a large dense rain forest, with trees 100-1000ft tall. At surface level beneath this jungle lies what is often referred to by locals as the [[Nammach:Underjungle|underjungle]]. 

To the east of the island the jungle thins out into grassy plains, eventually reaching a set of small rocky islands.

To the west of the island the jungle stops abruptly leading into a wet marsh.

In the north lie small scattered islands covered in jungle trees.

===== Government =====
Three [[Grippli]] clans currently controls parts of the island. The leaders of these clans are referred to as [[Daimyo]].
  * The [[Nammach:Teiji Clan|Teiji clan]] controls the majority of the central jungle and the entirety of the western coast.

  * The [[Nammach:Kanda Clan|Kanda clan]] controls some of the northern coast and islands.

===== Foreign Relations =====
In the year 1648 [[AF]] explorers from [[Cokumwatch]] found the southern coast of Nammach, meeting with the locals in the port city of [[Nammach:Gliney|Gliney]]. [[Tormod Teiji]], the Daimyo of the [[Nammoch:Teiji Clan|Teiji clan]] at the time met the explorers personally when they first landed. He helped quell the fear the locals had of these strange looking people. Later in 1650 [[AF]], once translators had been trained, a limited trade deal was made for trading the abundant food found in the jungle for [[gunpowder firearms]] and other advanced technology not available in Nammach.

In 1665 [[AF]] [[Laomann Teiji]] finalized a new trade deal, offering [[Cokumwatch]] as much food as their ships can carry for a much larger amount of [[gunpowder firearms]].
