====== Tregar ======
A very small town. Used to be inhabited by only a single isolationist [:Grippli]] family, but recently a lot of [[Knife Hunter]]s have been sailing to the place in hope of finding [[The Knife on The Sea]]. There are no trees and little fauna on the island, the temperature is very hot and it rains much less than other areas of [[:Nammach]]. There is also a very strong wind here.

Population: 50-100

===== Originals Hut ===== 
The original family that lived on the island live in a hut on the surface of the island. They get their food by fishing, and have a rain collector setup to get water. The family consists of a husband, wife and a son. They don't like to talk to anyone.

(TODO: There's probably something really weird about them)
Family is cursed with lyncanthropy? 

They have lived on the island for 20+ years, moving here to find a place where they would not be bothered by anyone.

A DC 20 perception check whilst at the cave at night will reveal that the son is atop the cave with a pickaxe swinging at the ground. The son is attempting to destabilize the cave roof to cause a cave in, preventing the hunters from living there.

===== Town =====
Most of the "town" that has been built up within the last 3 months or so has been done so by [[Knife Hunters]]. They have used a sea cave that is located beneath the cliffy northern side of the island. It helps protect them from the temperature and gives them shelter from the winds. 

==== The Hunters Inn ====
An Inn created by the group known as [[The Hunters of the Knife]]. They give free board to anyone who wishes to help them. 

==== Hunters of the Knife ====

=== Searching Procedure ===
  - Leave a log and description of all items on the ship before leaving.
  - Travel together for the duration, with at least 4 people awake at all times. 
  - Log the direction traveled and duration whenever an event occurs.

  - When returning, check every item on the ship against the list written initially. 
  - Record the direction and duration of the journey on the map.

=== Captain (Eacharn)===
A very experienced sailor and warrior. He is searching by his own choice.

== Past ==
Been looking for the knife off and on for 10 years. Lived in [[:Nammach:Caldy]] during that period, but previous to that lived in Pontow. With the recent influx of hunters, he moved permanently to Tregar to use and help the extra hunters there. 

His father went out looking for the knife when he was a child and never returned (was killed by a brine dragon after finding the knife multiple times). This inspired him to try and find the knife and perhaps find his father. 

== Theories ==
Has been searching a long time and has collected a great many notes and drawings. 

He suspects that sometimes when ships come back from hunting, their supplies and or ships are different. 
He is suspicious that they are only able to see the knife if the waters are too dangerous to get near (and this location seems to be the same every time). 
He is suspicious that when they search that same spot and don't find anything they are always gone for multiple weeks, even if they go out meaning to come back before that.
