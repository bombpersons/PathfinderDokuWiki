====== Tregar ======
A very small town. Used to be inhabited by only a single isolationist [:Grippli]] family, but recently a lot of [[Knife Hunter]]s have been sailing to the place in hope of finding [[The Knife on The Sea]]. There are no trees and little fauna on the island, the temperature is very hot and it rains much less than other areas of [[:Nammach]]. There is also a very strong wind here.

Population: 50-100

===== Originals Hut =====
The original family that lived on the island live in a hut on the surface of the island. They get their food by fishing, and have a rain collector setup to get water. The family consists of a husband and wife. They don't like to talk to anyone.

===== Town =====
Most of the "town" that has been built up within the last 3 months or so has been done so by [[Knife Hunters]]. They have used a sea cave that is located beneath the cliffy northern side of the island. It helps protect them from the temperature and gives them shelter from the winds. 

==== The Hunters Inn ====
An Inn created by the group known as [[The Hunters of the Knife]]. They give free board to anyone who wishes to help them.
