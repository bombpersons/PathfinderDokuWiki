====== Tregar ======
A small town sprung up here after [[:Iseabal Kanda]]s geas orders to look for [[The Knife on The Sea]]. The town was a convenient place to stay whilst searching. The dragon [[:Inilth]] rules this place.

The island has no trees and little fauna. It is significantly hotter and dryer here than islands closer to the mainland. It is also very windy here. 

Population: 50-100

===== Originals Hut ===== 
The original family that lived on the island live in a hut on the surface of the island. They get their food by fishing, and have a rain collector setup to get water. The family consists of a husband, wife and a son. They don't like to talk to anyone.

20 years ago, Cathal was a guard working at [[Nammach:Tydfon]]. A [[Lycanthropy|were-chimpanzee]] attacked the town, and Cathal successfully defended and slayed the creature, however he got bitten in the process. Fearing he was affected by the curse he requested that his wife chain him up every night. Once he had transformed once and almost broken his restraints, he decided that it was best for him to move to a far away place were no-one lived so that he was not a threat to anyone. His wife accompanied him. 

He arrived at Tregar finding no-one there. They built a cage in a cavern underneath their house in which he would sleep. They had a child 15 years after their exile. 

They continue to live on top of the island despite [[:Inilth]]s presence. [[:Inilth]] hasn't noticed them.

===== Town =====
The town the hunters had created within a sea cave on the island has been re-purposed by [[:Inilth]] as a prison. Townspeople are prevented from leaving the cave by [[:Inilth]] as he destroys any ship coming to the island. 

A standing guard of [[:Grindylow]] stay near the entrance of the cave. They deliver food to the captives every now and then. 

Townspeople with geas's on them have been collapsing, unable to move.
