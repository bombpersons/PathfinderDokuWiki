===== People =====

==== Tomas ====
The appointed governor of Porthca. Used to be a archer in the Kanda army.

===== Quest Hooks =====

==== Underground Hellions ====
Residents have been hearing strange growling and klinking sounds from underground.

Underneath the governors tower, a tunnel leads to a large cavern underneath the island, where the [[Buisreach]] Doirin mines deep into the earth, see [[Porthca:Deep Mine]].

If investigated, the PC's may find an NPC who's basement's floor has partially collapsed, revealing a dark cavern below.
They could also sneak into the tower, and find an entrance there.

If they find themselves in the mine, they will find that the mine is populated mostly by Hellions digging. The Hellions will be hostile. 2 hours after entering, Doirin herself and a party of 3 guards will enter and attempt to subdue the PCs.

At the bottom of the pit (10 miles deep), the PCs will find a solid metal wall and can hear a faint humming noise from behind it (it leads to the central [[:Kurji]] control center). It may take the party a few days to reach the bottom.

==== Unfair imprisonment ====
A band of ninja's ("Freedom") known for breaking people they perceive to be innocent out of prison has been caught and imprisoned themselves. The PCs find that there are more than a few locals who were supportive of their goals. 

If the PC's investigate they can locate where they are imprisoned. 

They are held in the dungeons beneath the tower.

Their leader Asgall and 3 other ninjas are imprisoned there.

A group of 10 soldiers guard the dungeon. They take alternating shifts, 5 at a time. 2 patrol the corridors at all times. The rest stay in guard room next to the cells. Tomas himself occasionally visits the dungeons (a 20%< chance at any time). If the alarm is raised, he can get there within 2 minutes.
