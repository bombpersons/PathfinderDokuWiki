====== Plini ======
Plini is a world founded by the [[:Great Benvaubo'u]] after finding a crack to [[:Higher Space]] in [[:High Space]]. A beam of energy coming from two separate breaches from [[:High space]], [[:Gusli'i Solri]] acts as a sun, producing a day night cycle.

===== History =====
==== Before the fall of the Great Benvaubo'u ====
As part of an attempt to find evidence of any higher planes than [[Higher Space]], the [[Great Benvaubo'u]] created a world within [[Higher space]] and seeded it with various lifeforms from [[:Low space]]. The hope was that as some creatures in [[Low space]] developed an affinity for predicting the fluctuations in [[High space]] and using that ability to manipulate reality, that this may eventually happen in [[:Higher space]] as well. If true, it would prove that there were yet higher planes that were still unknown.

==== After the fall of the Great Benvaubo'u ====
After the fall, with the [[:Great Benvaubo'u]]'s minions in disarray and memories lost, Plini was all but forgotten for 1000 years. Once order had been re-established, the [[:Great Benvaubo'u]]'s former minions now calling themselves the [[:Kirju]], Plini was rediscovered.

The newly formed [[:Kirju]] did not know the true reason for Plini's existence, so they brushed it aside mostly focusing mostly on re-affirming their control over [[:Low space]]. A small contingency is placed there just in case something strange happens. If any of their actions causes any inconvenience for inhabitants, they have a similar compensation program to the one they use in [[:Low space]]. Given the location can lead directly to [[:High space]], inhabitants that find out about it are usually picked up and their memory wiped.

===== Structure =====

==== Surface ====
The surface of Plini is made of rock, covered with a sea of water, forming continents. The surface is in the shape of a semi-sphere. Near the edges, where little light reaches, a lip curves upwards where the edge of the world lies.

==== Interior ==== 
40-50 km deep within the rock exterior, the core of Plini is a 1 meter thick shell of carbon nanotubes. Within this is a sprawling complex of monitoring equipment, and at the center a heavy duty lift 1km wide that leads directly to the sealed gate that leads to [[High Space]].

Within the complex are many unused sections that have not been visited since the fall of the [[:Great Benvaubo'u]], often referred to as [[Plini:The Forgotten Corridors]].

==== Portals ====
Beyond the gate at the bottom of the elevator, is the initial rip in [[High Space]] that lead to [[Higher Space]]. A small station is built out of the rip, as well as the generators for [[:Gusli'i Solri]]. The location itself is fairly remote, requiring a ship to travel to more populated regions of [[High Space]]. It is guarded by a small team managed by the [[:Kirju:Department of Plini]].

===== Kirju =====
The [[:Kirju]] [[:Kirju:Department of Plini]] is mostly left to it's own devices when managing Plini, without much outside interference from other [[:Kirju]] depratments. 

===== Nations =====
  - [[:Nammach]]
  - [[:Cokumwatch]]
  - [[:Gne]]
