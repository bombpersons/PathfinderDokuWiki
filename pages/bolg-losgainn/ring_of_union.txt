====== Ring of union ======
Usually come in pairs, or triples, each with similar markings. [[:Bolg-losgainn]] followers would use these to try and emulate the true collective of [[:Bolg-losgainn]], but the rings always ended up being limited and inferior.

When 2 or more people wear these rings, everyone must make will save. Whomever get's the highest role will take over the consciousness of all the ring wearers. They get the senses of all ring wearers at the same time and can control each body as if they were their own. If the ring is removed from someone, they re-gain their own free will.
