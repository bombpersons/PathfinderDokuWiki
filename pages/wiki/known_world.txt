====== Plini ======
Plini is a world founded by the [[:Great Benvaubo'u]] after finding a crack to [[:Higher Space]] in [[:High Space]]. A beam of energy coming from two separate breaches from [[:High space]], [[:Gusli'i Solri]] acts as a sun, producing a day night cycle.

===== History =====
==== Before the fall of the Great Benvaubo'u ====
As part of an attempt to find evidence of any higher planes than [[Higher Space]], the [[Great Benvaubo'u]] created a world within [[Higher space]] and seeded it with various lifeforms from [[:Low space]]. The hope was that as some creatures in [[Low space]] developed an affinity for predicting the fluctuations in [[High space]] and using that ability to manipulate reality, that this may eventually happen in [[:Higher space]] as well. If true, it would prove that there were yet higher planes that were still unknown.

==== After the fall of the Great Benvaubo'u ====
After the fall, with the [[:Great Benvaubo'u]]'s minions in disarray and memories lost, Plini was all but forgotten for 1000 years. Once order had been re-established, the [[:Great Benvaubo'u]]'s former minions now calling themselves the [[:Kirju]], Plini was rediscovered.

The newly formed [[:Kirju]] did not know the true reason for Plini's existence, so they brushed it aside mostly focusing mostly on re-affirming their control over [[:Low space]]. A small contingency is placed there just in case something strange happens. If any of their actions causes any inconvenience for inhabitants, they have a similar compensation program to the one they use in [[:Low space]]. Given the location can lead directly to [[:High space]], inhabitants that find out about it are usually picked up and their memory wiped.

===== Kirju =====
The [[:Kirju]] [[:Kirju:Department of Plini]] is mostly left to it's own devices when managing Plini, without much outside interference from other [[:Kirju]] depratments. 

===== Nations =====
  - [[:Nammach]]
  - [[:Cokumwatch]]
  - [[:Gne]]
