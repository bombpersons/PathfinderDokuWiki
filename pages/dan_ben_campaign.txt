There are 5 prospective buyers

==== Seasaidh (Shessi) MÃ rnach ====
Comes sect of [[Laghairt]] druids that has kept up the old traditions in secret (that's why she has a celtic second name). Wants to buy the item, but tries to do so anonymously so that no-one can trace the item.

She offers 50,000gp, no questions asked. She wants to meet outside of a pub, hires someone to meet wearing a cloak and hood. Gives a bag of 500pp, and takes the item. 

==== Pol Kijuro ====
An auctioneer who thinks that he would be able to get a very good price for it, suggesting as much as 100,000gp, as he has many clients who are interested in old artefacts like it.

In actuality, he is vying to steal the item when it is unguarded. 

==== Tomaidh Ieyasu ====
A professor at [[Nammach:Anfan university]], his speciality is ancient druid artifacts. Is willing to pay 500gp to take the item for a month to examine it. 

If the PC's take this option, 2 weeks into the examination, a band of thieves hired by Seasaidh will attempt to steal the item, DC 15 to succeed.

==== Barabla Izo ====
A curator for the [[Anfan]] druidic museum. Is asking for the PC's to donate the item.

==== Raibeart Benjiro ====
A private collector. Collects specifically crowns from druidic ruins. Has a collection of non-crown items he's acquired that he's willing to trade.
