===== The Rhythm =====
The Rhythm (usually referred to as "The Songs" by natives to [[Plini]]) is a natural phenomenon in which energy from a higher [[:Plane]] leaks into a lower [[:Plane]]. It is used for communication as well as intra-planar reality altering (by selectively amplifying the signal via resonance).

==== Busica ====
It's unknown if it's possible to hear a Rhythm in [[:Busica]]

==== Servica ====
If there is a Rhythm in [[:Servica]] it has not been investigated. 

==== Higher Space / Habica ====
[[:Servica]] uses this leaking to connect support calls. The audio from [[:Servica]] manifests as a localised "Song" that can be heard by the caller. 

Areas that are uninhabited are not connected to the support line and only the hold music can be heard. There are a set number of songs, which arcane casters living on [[:Plini]] use to their advantage. By learning the songs, they can synchronise with The Rhythm and use it to amplify reality altering effects. 

==== High Space ====
The [[:Kirju]] have not been able to detect any noticeable patterns in the vibrations of [[High Space]]. 

==== Low Space ====
The Rhythm heard in [[Low Space]] is still poorly understood. Theories range from large creatures in high space singing, to machines placed by a long dead civilisation. 

The Rhythm in [[Low Space]] is not uniform and changes based on position. In almost all regions The Rhythm is something that could be described as music, with a few areas with either no Rhythm or static noise. 

A few races in [[Low Space]] have evolved to be able to hear The Rhythm clearly and use it in a similar way to those on [[:Plini]], though it is markedly less powerful. 

Synchronising with The Rhythm is the most common method for achieving FTL travel in [[Low Space]] by space fairing civilisations.
