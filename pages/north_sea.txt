====== Nammachian North Sea ======
The north of [[Nammach]] is home to a vast archipelago of small jungle islands. [[Nammach:Anfan]] is the most populated of these, but there are many other small villages and towns located on them. Many of them are also home to [[Gnoll]] tribes. [[The Knife on the Sea]] is located in the far north.
