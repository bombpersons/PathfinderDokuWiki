====== Nammachian North Sea ======
The north of [[Nammach]] is home to a vast archipelago of small jungle islands. [[Nammach:Anfan]] is the most populated of these, but there are many other small villages and towns located on them. Many of them are also home to [[Gnoll]] tribes. [[The Knife on the Sea]] is located in the far north.

===== Inilth  =====
Inlith is a Brine Dragon Wyrm (1200 year old). He was magically aged by a wild magic surge and thus is immature for his age. He is rash and acts on his impulses. 

Whilst young, Inlith ruled over a small pod of dolphins. Pathetic even for a young brine dragon. After being aged, he grew much more powerful and saw this as his chance to finally proof himself.

He has take control of the local grindylow clans, as well as many other intelligent deep sea creatures. His plan is to subjugate the local [[Grippli]] population, boiling towns alive as he travels to [[Anfan]]. [[Tregar]] has already been destroyed.
