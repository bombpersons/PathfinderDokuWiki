===== Inilth  =====
Inlith is a Brine Dragon Wyrm (1200 year old). He was magically aged by a wild magic surge and thus is immature for his age. 

Inilth seas his ageing as a test. He believes he was given his ability by a god who sees potential in him, giving him the opportunity proof himself and ascend to godhood. 

He used his power to force the [[Grindylow]] living in [[Nammach:The Coral Castle]] to serve him, as well as the local [[Ceratiodi]] clans, whom he used as translators when speaking to [[Grippli]].

A pod of dolphins under his control before his ageing, he used as scouts to spy on the [[Grippli]].

His plan was to destroy the leadership of the [[Grippli]] and take their place.

==== Progress ====
  - Destroyed port at [[Nammach:Tregar]] and stopped anyone from leaving, capturing anyone who get's near and interrogating them.
